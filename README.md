## **üîßPROTECTING YOUR DATA** 
(when modifying for personal use)

#### **Step 1: From within VSCode in the root project directory, we will create a .gitignore file**

# For ![l-top](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/screenshots/v1.0.x/mac-pass-sm.png)
```js 
touch .gitignore 
```

# For ![l-top](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/screenshots/v1.0.x/windows-pass-sm.png)

```js 
ni .gitignore 
```

#### Step 2: commit that .gitignore file (this prevents your sensitive information from being shown to others). **‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU DO!‚ö†Ô∏è**

![setup](https://coding-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/entity-readme-image.png "Set up instructions")

#### Step 3: **To commit your .gitignore file enter the following commands**

## **üíªSETUP**

copy this url to clone this project to your local system:
```html
https://github.com/tmemmerson/DoctorOffice.Solution.git
```

<br>

Once copied, select "Clone Repository" from within VSCode & paste the copied link as shown in the image below.

![cloning](https://coding-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/clone-github2.gif "Cloning from Github within VSCode")

<br>

With the project open to the root directory, navigate to the production directory with the following commands in your terminal.
```js 
cd Factory
```

```js 
dotnet restore 
```

```js 
dotnet build 
``` 

```js 
dotnet ef database update 
``` 

Your application is now built, as well as the requisite database for this application. Now we run the program with...
```js 
dotnet run 
``` 



```js
git add .gitignore
```
```js
git commit -m "protect data"
```

#### Step 4: **Then, you need to update your username and password in the appsettings.json file.**

_by default these are set to user:root and an empty password. if you are unsure, refer to the settings for your MySqlWorkbench._
